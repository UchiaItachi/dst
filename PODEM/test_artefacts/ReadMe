File Descritpions:
------------------

tests.txt
---------
. This file is used as an input to the CircuitSimulator (can be named differently too, passed as the first argument to executable, mandatory argument)
. Every entry in this file contains a pair of files name (comma separated)
. <netlist_file> -> File name of the netlist
. <test_input_vectors_file> -> file containing input test vectors for a circuit (each line in this file contains an input vector)
. An example of the contents of tests.txt file shown below
e.g.
<netlist_file_1>, <test_input_vectors_file_1>
<netlist_file_2>, <test_input_vectors_file_2>
.. etc..


Netlist Files:
--------------
. Files containing the netlist or the circuit (e.g. s27.txt)

Input Test Vector file:
----------------------
. File containing input test "vectors" for a circuit (e.g. s27_input.txt)
. Each line represent a test vector
. Multiple test vectors given on each separate line


Output Files:
-------------
. Output files of the circuit simulation are dumped into this file
. It contains results for a circuit for all the test vectors applied to the circuit & simulated including the detected fault lists


*** NOTE ***
. It is mandatory that the netlist file and the test input vector files listed in "tests.txt" be in the same directory
. Also the outputs results used for fault coverage are captured in two separate files, just for reference only
  "FaultCoverageOutput_75.txt" & "FaultCoverageOutput_90.txt"
  "FaultCoverage_Graph_75.png" & "FaultCoverage_Graph_90.png"
